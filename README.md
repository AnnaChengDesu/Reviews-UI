Tech Stack: `Vue3` + `Vite` + `Typescript` + `Express` + `Firebase`

This was originally a practice project for learning Vue3 on youtube, which uses JSON Server (for local debugging) to simulate the full API through simple JSON files.

But occasionally I want to try if I could deploy it to my Github Page, and since I don't have a personal server, So I used Express as the server and deployed it to Vercel, and used Firebase as the database, and finally realized the page interaction.

I encountered a lot of problems with this project, but with the help of ChatGPT, they were solved one by one, and I documented those problems in my blog, so you can have a look if you're interested.
